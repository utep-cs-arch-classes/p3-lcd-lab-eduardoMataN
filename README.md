#### Lab 3: The Grounder 2.0

## Purpose:
The Grounder was designed to ground you when things start to get heavy. Over
40 million adults in the U.S. suffer from anxiety, and a small amount of those
people know of coping mechanisms to fight back. The Grounder has the purpose
of giving you something to focus on even if it's just for a short while, so
that you can get back on your feet.

## Instructions:

##will create all the necessary files for the toy to run. After that, go into
##the project folder and use "make" load for the MSP430 to be properly loaded.

### How to use?
Once the toy has been loaded onto the MSP430, you will hear a series of
sounds. This indicates that the toy is ready to be used. A message will be
displayed on the screen, asking you to enter a speed. You will select a speed
using the 4 switches, and each of them have been labeled on the screen (L=Low,
M=Medium, H=High).

Once you pick a speed, The Grounder will give you one of the three available
figures. Your task is to pay close attention and count how many times the
figure blinks on the screen.

Once you hear the series of noise again, you can select another speed. Make
sure to play close attention and let The Grounder bring you down.
